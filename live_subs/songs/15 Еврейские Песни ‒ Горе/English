Jewish Songs ‒ «Woe»
There was a grey cat, there was a warm house,
Mummy and I lived together!
It was nice for us then.<!s>
But with the war came unfortune into our house.<!s>
No more mummy, no more house,<!s>
No more bread, what is this?<!s>
Mummy won't come back now,<!s>
She sleeps in the grave, she will never wake.<!s>
Ash is all that remains of the house.
The little cat wanders all alone.<!s>
Mummy, mummy, where you, mummy!<!s>
The snowstorm storms, and the wind howls.
I have no roof over mu head,
I now approach and stand at another's door.<!s>
Give me shelter, for God's sake!
