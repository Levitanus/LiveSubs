The Nursery ‒ «Stick horse ride»
“Hey! Trot, trot! Hey, giddyap! Hey! Hey!<!s>
Whoa! Stop! <!s>
Vasya, Vasya!<!s>
Listen, come over to play today!
Only ... it's late!<!s>
Well, you trot on! Trot! <!s>
Bye, Vasya!
I went to Yukki...
But I’ll [get there] before night falls,
We’re put to bed early, extremely early... 
Come, see!<!s>
Ta, ... ta, hey! Tа, ..., ta, let’s go!
Trot! Hey, giddyap! Hey, hey, let’s go! Hey, hey! Crushed!<!s>
Oh, it hurts! Oh, [my] leg!” <!s>
“My dear, little boy, what’s wrong?
Well, enough to [make you] cry!<!s>
Come, my friend!
Hang on, stand on the right foot:
There, child! <!s>
Look, how lovely!
Do you see?
In the bushes to your left! <!s>
Аh, what a divine bird!
What plumage!
Do you see? … <!s>
Over there? It’s gone?” <!s>
“It’s gone! I rode to Yukki, Mama!
Now we need to hurry home ...
Trot! Trot! Guets are coming ... Trot!
We need to hurry! ...”
