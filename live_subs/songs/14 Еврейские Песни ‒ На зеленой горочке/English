Jewish Songs ‒ «On the Green Hillside»
On the green hillside
Grows a little young tree,
The little young tree doesn't want to sleep!<!s>
The moon cautions it:
Time to sleep, little tree,
On the green hillside!<!s>
The stars say the same thing,
But the tree won't listen!
Won't clkse its eyes!<!s>
A breeze comes up:
Little tree, little tree, be calm!<!s>
And shakes it and craddles it in sleep!
Ah, ah.<!s>
Shakes it here, shakes it there,
A little green tree must sleep!
A little green tree must slumber!<!s>
The little three slumbers
On the green hillside:
The Little tree slumbers.
