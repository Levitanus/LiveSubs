Jewish Songs ‒ «Lullaby»
Kitty, quiet!
Mousey, quiet!
My sweetie
Wants in sleep now!<!s>
Little calves, little calves,
don't bleat.
And don't awaken
My sweetie!<!s>
Don't whirl,
Little breeze!
Quieter, quieter,
Little doggie!<!s>
Bite
Your tongue,
For my little boy
Wants to sleep!
Lulla-by, lulla-by, ab.
