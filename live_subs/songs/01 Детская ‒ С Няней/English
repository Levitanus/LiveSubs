The Nursery ‒ «With Nanny»
Tell me, Nanny, tell me, sweetheart,
Tell me about that scary boogeyman:<!s>
How that boogeyman roamed the woods,
How that boogeyman carried children into the woods<!s>
And how he gnawed on their white bones,
And how the children cried and cried!<!s>
Nanny! But the beetle ate them, the children,<!s>
For hurting the old nanny,
They didn't listen to daddy and mommy.<!s>
Isn't that why he ate them, Nanny?<!s>
Or this: Tell me about the tsar and the tsarina,
who lived in a rich house across the sea.<!s>
The tsar had a limp,
When he stumbled, a mushroom would grow,<!s>
The tsarina had a runny nose,
When she sneezed, the glass shattered!<!s>
You know, Nanny:
Don't tell me about the boogeyman! Never mind the boogeyman!<!s>
Tell me the funny one, Nanny!
