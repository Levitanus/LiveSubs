Jewish Songs ‒ «The Hunter»
Yankele wants to be a hunter,
Yankele wants to go off into the woods,
He only wants to shoot a bear,
Only a bear he wants to shoot
But where will he get a gun?<!s>
Our Yankele sees
A broom standing in the corner!
With the broom he will hunt,
Hunt and kill a big bear!<!s>
In the house he can no longer stay!
He wants to pick up the broom,
But the heavy broom falls over
And the hunter falls over it!<!s>
No bear and no rabbit,
With a broken nose!<!s>
He no longer wants to go to the woods,
He no longer wants to be a hunter!
