The Nursery ‒ «With a doll»
Tyapa, bye, bye, Tyapa, bye, bye,
Calm yourself down! Tyapa! <!s>
You need to sleep!
Tyapa, sleep, sleep, Tyapa, or the boogeyman will come
a big wolf will come, and carry you into the dark forest.<!s>
Tyapa, sleep, go to sleep!
What you see in your dreams, tell me about it:<!s>
About a wonderful island, where you don’t need to reap nor sow,
Where pear trees bloom and ripen,
Day and night golden birds sing!<!s>
Bye, bye, hushabye, bye, bye, Tyapa!
