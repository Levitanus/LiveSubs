The Nursery ‒ «Beetle»
‒ Nurse, Nanny!
‒ What happened?
‒ Dear Nanny!<!s>
I was playing over there in the sand,
near the gazebo, by the birch trees,
I’d built a house of the finest maple pieces,
Those, that my own Mama herself cut out for me.<!s>
The little house was finished being built,
A little house with a roof, a proper little house, when all of a sudden...<!s>
Onto the same roof, a beetle lands,
Huge, black, so fat,
wiggling his moustache in such a scary way,
And right at me, he was looking!<!s>
I was frightened! But the beetle is buzzing, angrily,
His wings spread, he wants to grab me! . . .<!s>
And he flew, and right here in the temple, he hit me!<!s>
I crouched down, Nanny,<!s>
sat down, afraid to move!<!s>
Only one of my eyes opened a bit,<!s>
And what’s more, look, Nanny:<!s>
The beetle is lying there, with folded legs,
his nose in the air, on his back,
And it’s not at all angry, and his moustache doesn’t move,
And he’s definitely not buzzing, only the wings are trembling.<!s>
So? He died? Or he was pretending?<!s>
What was it, what, tell me, Nurse, 
What happened to the beetle? He hit me, and he fell!
What happened to him, that beetle?
