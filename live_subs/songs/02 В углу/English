The Nursery ‒ «In the corner»
Oh, you mischief-maker!
The skein of wool has been unwound, knitting needles lost,
Oh, you! The stitches have been dropped!
The stocking is all splashed with ink!<!s>
In the corner! In the corner!
Go stand in the corner!
Prankster!<!s>
I didn’t do anything, Nanny,
I didn’t touch your knitting, Nanny!<!s>
The wool stocking was unwound by the little kitten,<!s>
And the needles were lost by that kitty,<!s>
But Mikey was a good boy,
Mikey was a clever boy.<!s>
But Nanny is angry, old,
and her nose is dirty.<!s>
Mikey is clean, well-combed,<!s>
But Nanny’s cap is crooked.<!s>
Nanny hurt Mikey’s feelings,
and now he has to stand in the corner.<!s>
Mikey doesn't love Nanny anymore, so there!
