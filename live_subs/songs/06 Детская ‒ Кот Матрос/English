The Nursery ‒ «“Sailor” the Cat»
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Mama, dear Mama!
I was going to find [my] parasol,
Mama, it’s very hot, I dug around in the chest
and looked in the table: no, on purpose!
I quickly ran to the window,
maybe the parasol had been forgotten out there...<!s>
Suddenly I see it, on the windowsill, our cat “Sailor,” 
climbing on the birdcage, scratching [at it]!<!s>
The bullfinch trembles, hides in the corner, peeps.<!s>
I was furious! “Hey, brother, before you polish off the little bird!<!s>
No, wait, you’re caught. I see you, cat!” <!s>
As if nothing had happened, I stand still, look to the side, <!s>
Only keeping one eye on him:
what a strange creature!<!s>
The cat calmly looks me in the eye,
And his paw reaches into the cage anyway:<!s>
only thinking about grabbing the bullfinch,
so I slapped him!<!s>
Mama, how hard the cage [was]!
My fingers hurt so much, Mama!<!s>
Mama! Right on the tips, right here,
it’s aching, it aches right here...<!s>
No! What a bad cat, Mama, right?
